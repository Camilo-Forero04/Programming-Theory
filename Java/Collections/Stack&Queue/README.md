### STACK VS QUEUE

### STACK IMPLEMENTATION

Stack follows the LIFO behavior, this means that the last element you insert will be the first to get out the list

### QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION

Queue in the other hand, follows the FILO, this means that the first element you insert will be the first to get out of the list
